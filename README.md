### Project Title : Data Literacy Project  
---
### project overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the ability to read, write, analyze, communicate, and reason with data. It’s a skill that allows individuals and organizations to make better, data-driven decisions. As with other key competencies, it’s not a one-size-fits-all concept; multiple facets make up data literacy. It is more than just data analysis; instead, it involves understanding what data means and how to present those findings.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here are surveys, questionaires and interviews, these are some common sources data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle database or Google dataset search or any other data repository site.

### Store Data

1.  For data cleaning
2.  For analysis
3.  For data visualization

### Data Cleaning And Preparation
A significant part of my role as a data analyst is cleaning data to prepare it for analysis. Data cleaning (also called data scrubbing) is the process of removing incorrect and duplicate data, managing any holes in the data, and ensuring consistent formatting. 

These are common data cleaning in excel Task:
- Remove duplicates
-  Standardize formats
-  Even out casing and remove extra spaces
-  Split delimited data
-  Find and replace
-  Extract prefixes and suffixes
-  Check for spelling and typos
-  Fill missing values

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is all about answering questions with data. Exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short, helps me explore what questions to ask. This could be done separately from or in conjunction with data cleaning.

- Ask lots of questions about the data.
- Discover the underlying structure of the data.
- Look for trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
- Test hypotheses and validate assumptions about the data.
- Think about what problems you could potentially solve with the data.

 ### Data visualization





   

-SQL- Structured query language for querying of Data 
- GITHub for portfolio building

 ### Data cleaning and preparation 
 in the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following action;
 1. data cleaning
 2. handling missing variable
 3. data cleaning and formatting


EDA involve the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- which is the overall sales trend
- which product are top sellers
- what are the products on peak sales?

  ### Data Analysis
  This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis

  ''' SQL'''

  ~~~SQL
  SELECT * FROM TABLE1
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
