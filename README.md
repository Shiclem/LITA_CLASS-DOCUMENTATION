project title: Data Analysis Project 

## Data sources
The primary source of data used here is data sale.csv and this is an open sources data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

## Tools used 
miscrosoft Excel , and (download here)(https://www.microsoftexcel.com)
1. For data cleaning
2. For analysis
3. For data visualization


## project overview

## Data cleaning
A significant part of my role as a data analyst is cleaning data to prepare it for analysis. Data cleaning (also called data scrubbing) is the process of removing incorrect and duplicate data, managing any holes in the data, and ensuring consistent formatting. 

There are some multiple files gathered from multiple sources without much curation. Some sites where you to find “dirty” data sets to work with include:

1.Data.gov

2.Data.world


## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is all about answering questions with data. Exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short, helps you explore what questions to ask. This could be done separately from or in conjunction with data cleaning. Either way, you’ll want to accomplish the following during these early investigations.

1.Ask lots of questions about the data.
2.Discover the underlying structure of the data.
3.Look for trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
4.Test hypotheses and validate assumptions about the data.
5.Think about what problems you could potentially solve with the data.

## Data visualization
Humans are visual creatures, which makes data visualization a powerful tool for transforming data into a compelling story to encourage action. Great visualizations are not only fun to create, but they also have the power to make portfolio look beautiful.

This data analysis project aims 



   

-SQL- Structured query language for querying of Data 
- GITHub for portfolio building

 ### Data cleaning and preparation 
 in the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following action;
 1. data cleaning
 2. handling missing variable
 3. data cleaning and formatting


EDA involve the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- which is the overall sales trend
- which product are top sellers
- what are the products on peak sales?

  ### Data Analysis
  This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis

  ''' SQL'''

  SELECT * FROM TABLE1
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
  '''
